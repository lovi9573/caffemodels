* Final Project - Model Bias Based Clustering
***********************

=== Description ===
The files in this directory are those used to run model bias based clustering.


=== Dependencies ===
These files require the following software packages be available.
- python 2.7
- Tensorflow
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

=== Setup ===
The definition of the clustering process is contained in column_definition.py.  
The various hyperparameters and layer composition of the autoencoders is contained in that file.

You will also need an output directory.  This directory should have three directories within it:
- "img" Used to store images relating to the training process
- "log" Used to store logs of the autoencoder weights during training
- "check" Used to checkpoint the autoencoder across the different phases of training


=== Running the Algorithm ===
To pretrain an autoencoder on all data run the following:

	python pretrain_columns.py <path to output root (contains: img, check, log)> <path to data> 
	cifar ex:  ipython pretrain_columns.py ./output/ ./cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_1
	mnist ex:  ipython pretrain_columns.py ./output/ ./mnist/mnist_images.gz ./mnist/mnist_labels.gz
	
To pretrain one autoencoder on a sampling of each class label

	python pretrain_columns_labeled.py <path to output root (contains: img, check, log)> <path to data> 
	cifar ex:  ipython pretrain_columns_labeled.py ./output/ ./cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_1
	
To run the clustering algorithm

	python dynamic_columns.py <path to output root (contains: img, check, log)> <path to data> 
	cifar ex:  ipython pretrain_columns.py ./output/ ./cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_1	
	
NOTE: Each of these will load a checkpoint file to initialize the autoencoders if one exists in the output/check directory.
      If these programs are run in order they will progressively build on each other using the same autoencoder(s).
